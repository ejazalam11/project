				<p>
                The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3-Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M. M3 models have been derived from the E30, E36, E46, E90/E92/E93, and F80 3-series, and sold with coupe, saloon and convertible body styles. Upgrades over the "standard" 3-Series automobiles include more powerful and responsive engines, improved handling/suspension/braking systems, aerodynamic body enhancements, and interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" emblem. The last M3 coupe was produced in Germany on 5 July 2013, replaced by the M4 Coupe starting with the 2015 model year, but the M3 name will remain in use for the saloon version.

				<h1>BMW M5</h1>
				
				<p>
			   The BMW M5 is a high performance version of the 5 Series executive car built by the Motorsport division of BMW. Beginning production in 1986, the first incarnation of the M5 was hand-built utilizing the 535i chassis and a modified BMW M1 engine, being the fastest production sedan in the world at the time of its introduction. Subsequent iterations of the M5 have been built from each generation of the 5-Series platform, including the E34, E39, E60/E61, and most recently, F10, with the first orders delivered in late 2011.

				<h1>BMW X5</h1>
				
				<p>
				The BMW X5 is a midsize luxury SUV produced by BMW. The first generation of the X5, with the chassis code E53, made its debut in 1999. It was BMW's first SUV, also known as "Four-by-Four" in the UK, which featured 4WD all-wheel drive and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. In 2006 the second generation X5 was launched, known internally as the E70, featuring the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic transmission, and in 2009 the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model. BMW branded the X5 as a Sport Activity Vehicle rather than an SUV, to emphasize its on-road ability despite its size.

				<h1>BMW E9</h1>
				
				<p>
					The BMW New Six CS was a two-door coupé built for BMW by Karmann from 1968 to 1975. It was developed from the New Class-based BMW 2000CS coupé, which was enlarged to hold the BMW M30 straight-6 engine used in the E3 sedan. The E9 platform, especially the 3.0CSL homologation special, was very successful in racing, especially in European Touring Car Championship and the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft. This helped to establish BMW's status as a sporty driver's car.
