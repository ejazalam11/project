				<h1>Nissan GT-R </h1>
				
				<p>
                Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan and achieved much fame and success on both road and track.
				</p>
                
                <p>
				The GT-R is an entirely new model, sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.

				<h1>Nissan Altima</h1>
				
				<p>
					The Nissan Altima is a mid-size car manufactured by Nissan, and is a continuation of the Nissan Bluebird line, which began in 1957. It is the #1 selling Nissan model. The Altima primarily competes in the mainstream mid-size sedan class in the United States against its main rivals, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, managing to become the second best-selling car in the United States in 2011. It has historically been larger, more powerful, and more luxurious than the Nissan Sentra but less so than the Nissan Maxima. The Altima is exclusively manufactured in the United States and officially sold in North and South America, along with the Middle East and Australia. For other markets, Nissan.

				<h1>Nissan 370Z</h1>
				
				<p>
					The Nissan 370Z (known as the Fairlady Z Z34 in Japan) is a 2-door, 2-seater sports car (S-segment in Europe) manufactured by Nissan Motor Company.[3] It was announced on October 29, 2006 and was first shown at an event in Los Angeles ahead of the 2008 Greater LA Auto Show,[4] before being officially unveiled at the show itself.[5][6] The 370Z is the sixth-generation of the Nissan Z-car line, succeeding the 350Z.

				<h1>Nissan Rogue</h1>
				
				<p>
                The Nissan Rogue is a mid-size crossover SUV that debuted in October 2007 for the 2008 model year, produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan. It is the North American version of the European-designed Qashqai, known as the Dualis in Japan and Australia. The Nissan Rogue made its debut at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on January 7, 2007. It replaces the Nissan X-Trail in Canada as Nissan's entry-level SUV and the body-on-frame Nissan Xterra in Mexico due to the Smyrna plant freeing capacity for the 2009 Suzuki Equator, but the Xterra continues on sale in the United States and Canada after being withdrawn from the Mexican market after the 2008 model year.

				<h1>Nissan Sentra</h1>
				
				<p>
					The Nissan Sentra is a compact car produced by automaker Nissan Motors and is generally a rebadged export version of the Japanese Nissan Sunny until 2006. As of 2013 it is the rebadged export version of the Japanese Nissan Sylphy. The "Nissan Sentra" nameplate is not used in Japan. In the United States, the Sentra currently serves as Nissan's compact car and the prices range from $16,430 for a base model to $24,000 for a loaded top-of-the-line Sentra. While previous Sentras were subcompact cars, the Sentra has grown over the years, with the Nissan Versa having replaced the Sentra in the entry-level area, and the Sentra is now rated by the US EPA as a mid-size car due to its interior volume.

				<h1>Nissan 350Z</h1>
				
				<p>
					The Nissan 350Z (known as Nissan Fairlady Z in Japan) is a two-door, two-seater sports car that was manufactured by Nissan Motors from 2002 to 2009 and marks the fifth generation of Nissan's Z-car line. The 350Z entered production in late 2002 and was sold and marketed as a 2003 model. The first year there was only a coupe, as the roadster did not debut until the following year. Initially, the coupe came in Base, Enthusiast, Performance, Touring and Track versions, while the Roadster was limited to Enthusiast and Touring trim levels. The Track trim came with lightweight wheels and Brembo brakes, but its suspension tuning was the same as all other coupes. The Nissan 350Z has been succeeded by the 370Z since the 2009 model year.

				<h1>Nissan Fuga</h1>

				<h1>Nissan Titan</h1>
				
				<p>
				The Titan is a valiant attempt to challenge trucks from Ford and GM, but it doesn’t quite hit the mark. While it can giddyap and go and has sufficient stopping power, its ride, steering, and handling aren’t as refined as the competition. Its large, comfortable cabin has cushy seats, but its infotainment system disappoints. The Titan can tow up to 9740 pounds which is more than enough for most owners, and every model can pull at least 9110 pounds with a max of 9740 pounds.
